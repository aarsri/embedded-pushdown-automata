# Embedded Pushdown Automaton (EPDA) Emulator

Please define your machine in `sampleConfig.py` and run `$python epda.py$` from the command line.  The script will prompt you to provide the desired input string.  In the command line, you will see a visualization of the stack at each step.  If a step involved nondeterminism, you will have the option to repeat the step.  Finally, you will see whether the input was accepted or rejected.
